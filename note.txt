READ ALL OF THIS FILE BEFORE YOU START ANY SIMULATION

GNU Radio, MATLAB and the BELLHOP software need to be installed
Gr-Spread Module need to be install in GNU Radio for FH-CPFSK.


1-Put your arrival files is the same directory as this note is in.
2-open pskProcessing.m in MATLAB
3- call pskProcessing as follow:

pskProcessing(5,540,'BPSK')

where 5 is the number of arrival files you have
540 is the record time of the wav file of BPSK which should be in the same directory as this one.

A .wav file of a certain modulation techniques should be placed in the same directory as pskProcessing.

To generate a wav file or a certain modulation techniques run its sender python file and copy the output file that was generated and paste it to the same directory as this one.

The option to be used as input for pskProcessing for each modulated technique is as follow:

FSK use ‘GFSK’ as input for pskProcessing
FH-CPFSK  use ‘FH-FSK’ as input for pskProcessing
OFDM use ‘OFDM’ as input for pskProcessing
BPSK use ‘BPSK’ as input for pskProcessing


you may have to change the name of the impulseResponse in pskProcessing.m

(OPTIONAL) In pskProcessing change the variable direct to match the modulation techniques and symbol time to be used.

AFTER all wav files have been generated into several directories, copy and paste the required files from the modulation scheme folder into the directory of the variable direct in pskProcessing.

After all the above is done, run GNU.sh shell script. (some parameters inside the script might need to be adjusted like number of files etc.)

NOTE: MEANBER helps calculate the mean Bit Error Rate from several folders.
